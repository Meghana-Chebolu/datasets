1,1,5,1,1,Shami to Gaikwad,"full on off stump, a hint of away shape, good stride forward for a crisp push-drive to mid-off"
1,2,6,0,0,Shami to Gaikwad,"length ball close to off stump, defended into the covers"
1,3,7,0,1,Shami to Gaikwad,"lovely shot to get CSK off the mark. Length ball again, a bit more width on this occasion, and Gaikwad presses forward before opening his bat face to ease the ball between point and backward point"
1,4,7,1,-1,Shami to Gaikwad,"fullish, angling into the pads, and there's some late movement away, off the pitch, as Gaikwad attempts the flick. Leading edge flies in the air and bounces down to the right of deep backward point"
1,5,6,0,1,Shami to Gaikwad,"length ball outside off, presses forward and punches firmly to short extra-cover"
1,6,2,-1,1,Shami to Gaikwad,"shot! That's not particularly short, and it only gets up to about thigh height, but Gaikwad swivels quickly on his back foot and pulls it along the floor, placing it a long way to the left of long leg"
2,1,3,0,0,Hardik to Conway,"length ball angling across to finish close to off stump, gets forward and pushes to the left of point, who moves quickly to cut off the single"
2,2,3,-1,1,Hardik to Conway,"first six of the innings, and it's a top shot from Conway. Steps out, steps away to the leg side to create room, and slices this ball, with the angle, over cover point and all the way for six"
2,3,4,1,0,Hardik to Conway,steps out again and Hardik shortens his length while following Conway's movement to the leg side. Defended into the mid-off region
2,4,2,1,-1,Hardik to Gaikwad,"back of a length, nips back in towards off stump. Looks to dab into the point region with an open face, gets a thick inside edge into the backward square leg region"
2,5,0,-1,-1,Hardik to Conway,"back of a length slower ball, ends up down the leg side. Conway looks to swat it away off his hip and fails to connect"
2,6,8,-1,1,Hardik to Conway,"delivers one on the pads now, and Conway just whips it away fine, too file for long leg to be able to cut it off. Just the kind of over CSK needed to get themselves going"
2,7,2,1,1,Hardik to Conway,shuffles out to this length ball finishing near the top of off stump. Opens his bat face to dab to the right of backward point for a quick single
3,1,5,0,1,Shami to Conway,"shot. Back of a length ball angling in to finish around fourth stump, and Conway presses forwarfd and swats it between mid-on and midwicket"
3,2,7,0,1,Shami to Conway,"four more. Superb wristwork on this occasion. Uses the round-the-wicket angle expertly, meets this length ball on an off-stumpish line and whips it behind square, in the air, beats deep backward square leg sprinting to his left"
3,3,2,-1,1,Shami to Conway,"steps out, steps leg-side, and gets leg-side of a leg-stump ball to slice it to the right of deep backward point"
3,4,0,1,-1,Shami to Gaikwad,"past the edge! Back of a length in the corridor, and it nips away with extra bounce as Gaikwad looks to jab it away square without moving his feet"
3,5,6,1,1,Shami to Gaikwad,length ball straightening towards the top of off stump. Stays leg side of the ball and manufactures a soft-hands single into the off side
3,6,7,-1,1,Shami to Conway,"length ball on the pads, clipped to deep backward square leg"
4,1,3,0,1,Rashid Khan to Conway,"shot! Makes room to a slightly short-of-length ball straightening towards off stump, and punches it brilliantly to find the gap to the left of backward point"
4,2,0,1,-1,Rashid Khan to Conway,"senses that he'll try and make room again and fires a quick legbreak at the pads. Misses the flick, and gets a leg bye into the off side. Lbw appeal is quickly aborted because it pitched outside leg, hit the pad outside leg, and was missing leg stump on a second set of imaginary stumps"
4,3,6,1,1,Rashid Khan to Gaikwad,steps out to a ball turning from leg to middle and pushes inside-out towards cover
4,4,8,1,-1,Rashid Khan to Conway,"premeditates a sweep to a ball that's too short for the stroke, and he's beaten and smacked in the chest for his troubles. Picks up a leg bye, though"
4,5,5,0,1,Rashid Khan to Gaikwad,"bam. CSK are getting off to a great start here. Wrong'un from Rashid, on the fuller side, and he gets his front leg out of the way to manufacture room and launch it sweetly over mid-off"
4,6,7,0,1,Rashid Khan to Gaikwad,"just a touch short, legbreak turning away from off stump, and Gaikwad makes room for the square-cut and beats backward point diving to his right"
5,1,2,-1,1,Noor Ahmad to Conway,"back of a length wide of off stump, reaches out and stabs to the right of deep backward point"
5,2,4,1,0,Noor Ahmad to Conway,"looks to make room and the wrong'un follows him, keeps a bit low too. Punched back to the bowler off the back foot"
5,3,4,0,0,Noor Ahmad to Conway,"full outside off, too full to get underneath. Driven down to long-off, all along the ground"
5,4,7,1,1,Noor Ahmad to Gaikwad,"back of a length, straightens towards the top of off. Makes room and punches to the off-side sweeper"
5,5,0,1,-1,Noor Ahmad to Conway,"shortish wrong'un, turns down the leg side, beats the attempted pull"
5,6,4,0,-1,Noor Ahmad to Conway,"wrong'un, I think? Looped up wide outside off, and Conway snatches too eagerly at the cover drive. Ends up dragging it back to the bowler off the inside half of the bat"
5,7,8,0,0,Noor Ahmad to Conway,"shortish wrong'un finishing on the pads. Swipes it to the right of short fine leg, where Josh Little makes a good diving stop"
6,1,6,0,0,Little to Conway,"short on off stump, Conway pulls and hits it in the air, but doesn't middle it and the ball lands safely in front of deep midwicket, where Rashid runs in from the boundary and to his right and overruns the nball a little"
6,2,6,0,0,Little to Conway,"another short ball, gets up a little higher outside off, and Conway pulls into the gap to the right of Rashid at deep midwicket. He overruns the ball again, but turns around quickly and fields it casually with his left hand"
6,3,3,0,0,Little to Conway,"back of a length close to off stump, punched to extra-cover. Seemed to stop on him slightly"
6,4,3,0,1,Little to Gaikwad,"back of a length, angling across to off stump, clears the front leg and pulls along the ground to deep midwicket"
6,5,3,0,-1,Little to Conway,"slower ball, fullish on off stump, makes a bit of room and drives to the right of Miller at extra-cover. Moves quickly to the ball and throws at the keeper's end, with no one backing up, and concedes an overthrow"
6,6,6,-1,1,Little to Conway,"shot! First post-powerplay boundary and it's a six. Not a genuine half-tracker, but it sits up nicely outside off for Conway to pull with conviction and clear the midwicket boundary"
